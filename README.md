# How to start
(server) npm install->nodemon index.mjs<br />
(client) npm install -> npm start


# How to use
In login first
use the deck, to create delete update add new deck
* Note the deck will not refresh the window, please go to the home page and back
* Also, you can only enter the card page through the C button on each deck, this means you will CRUD cards in this specific deck

You can do the same thing for cards just like deck

# Note 
* I remove the .env file by adding it to the .gitignore. So, please add you own mongdb url and password to make this app running. </br>

# FlashCard
FlashCard MERN project
<p>I wish to document my recent efforts on the MERN stack project, the Flashcard Web App, in my first engineering journal. As a solo developer, I built the application from scratch and opted not to utilize additional CSS libraries like Bootstrap, which resulted in an imperfect appearance.
</p>

<p>During this project, I gained valuable experience in utilizing the MongoDB database in production mode. Previously, my knowledge of MongoDB was limited to simple CRUD operations. However, in this app, I performed more complex operations such as handling user authentication by storing usernames and passwords, as well as performing CRUD operations for deck and card information. I also linked parent deck IDs to their respective child card items, allowing users to access all the relevant child cards with a single click.
</p>


<p>While this project may not have been overly challenging, it was a significant milestone for me, as I completed it without relying on tutorials or pre-existing code. Additionally, I successfully implemented a separate client-server architecture for the application. I am immensely proud of my accomplishments and look forward to undertaking more significant projects in the future.</p>
